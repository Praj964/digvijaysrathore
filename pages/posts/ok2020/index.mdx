It's 25th of December when I'm writing this. I was willing to do a live stream talking about my journey so far (basically 2020 tbh) and sharing my excitement for things I 
am willing to do in 2021 but am not able to make time for that, so for now this post will suffice. 

## // explorations

When I look back, I have spent my time since 8th standard (11 y/o) trying things out which led me discover what I enjoy doing.  I wrote a short book, started
youtube channels, tried making documentaries, launched an app, put together electronic boards. Just exploring and staying curious was the hack to find interests!

## // bootstrapped

Honestly, 2020 is the year I grew the most and it wouldn't have been possible without the descreased academic pressure because of covid. It's funny, I started my career
in a pandemic!! There were certainly big realizations I had this year which laid a foundation for me to approach things. It's when I discovered my "art" and learnt combining
interests. 

Finding relevant online communities early this year accelerated my explorations!      

I am ready to take off now!

*take off = explore tech, build and create impact.

â€” some questions below with no generic answers, I want to keep addressing them personally and publish on the internet.

**"What's the meaning of life"**    
Based on what I explored, there's no meaning. I am a part of this never ending, infinite cosmos, so why would my efforts matter to anyone? The mindset which is idealized by me
is to consider my work as art, something that is done for the sake of doing it. One is supposed to find that interest or hobby and find their own meaning.

**"How do I find my passion?"**

An advice I would want to give my younger  self is to just explore, stay curious, develop interests. This is the year when I realized the notion that there is
that one magical thing which will always keep you interested is all wrong.    

Meeting new people can be a catalyst in building interests.

Examining the life of people like Da Vinci, Carl Sagan, Hawkings, Tesla, Aaron Swartz, I have always thought what made these individuals do wonders, what drove them?
Well, I didn't got any solid answer and mine may not make sense for others but on a broader level, it's the curiosity which they had.

Well, I didn't got any solid answer and mine may not make sense for others but on a broader level, it's the curiosity which they had. The straight forward question for me was,
what to be curious about? Simple, what do I like? When I look back, I have spent my time since 8th standard (11 y/o) trying things out which led me discover what I enjoy doing.

all wrong. Naval Ravikant puts it better, in [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qHkcs3kG44) episode.     
Another question that often drives me crazy is what the meaning of life is. -->
