It's 25th of December when I'm writing this. I was willing to do a live stream talking about my journey so far (basically 2020 tbh) and sharing my excitement for things I 
am willing to do in 2021 but am not able to make time for that, so for now this post will suffice. 

**— background**

- Ever since I was around 8-10, I was interested in DIYs/making stuff.
- In my POV at that time, scientists were the people who create so I idealized them.
- Fast forward to 8th standard when I learnt how to use internet for educating myself, I found that you no more have to go the conventional route to create stuff.
- I gradually started losing interest in academics and did a whole bunch of things at side.
- I discovered the term entrepreneurship and was sort of impressed by the people of that kind i.e. hacky approach towards things, it just suited my personality.
- Was unsure what could be my first step into it, well.. I started a Youtube channel around fitness & DIYs.
- Right from youtube, I found about Arduino & seriously, that thing was just crazy. Now I can "actually" start building a product.
- For almost 2-3 months, I tinkered with it and other sorts of hardware.
- Searching some arduino tuts, I found an article on how to build an android app using Cordova framework, I was like "woah!! can I do that thing too".
- Aha! I was now determined to build and launch an app. Copy/pasted code from random websites without knowing anything around Javascript, HTML, CSS.
- I was finally be able to put together a working APK of an app that suggests recipes based on ingredients. It was all hard coded, I created a JSON object with nearly 150 recipes and their ingredients manually b/c I didn't knew about APIs (oof!).
- It was quite an experience, picked up random how-tos from w3schools around adding different styles. Copied and never touched the js to implement fuzzy search, it was scary haha. Was not ready to ask anyone for the money to put my app on Play Store so went with listing it on Amazon app store.
- Bored vv soon, this time decided to write a short book (just a term I introduced as my book was shorter in content thatn I expected).
- Compiled some of the sci-fi concepts in a 32 page booklet and named it dynamism.
- Sold 10-20 copies of it to my friends and family and made rs. 600 net.
- Very soon, I was looking for some service to help me get a proper book published. Got to know a lot of concepts related to publishing and after a few days of digging, found the perfect one - Notion Press.
- They offered free publishing and some share on every sale, alright! Invested my 600 into getting some author copies and none of them was sold haha.
- I decided to level up my game by making a wordpress website and start blogging around so called science fiction, all on free hosts and domain. Named my company dadadadadada.... "SciSky".
- This was the time I started using social media, I mean something public like LinkedIn and Instagram.
- Again getting bored with writing, I started a podcast. Well, was going good but meh.. wasn't satisfied.
- Now (march 2019 onwards), I decided to learn some skills and freelance. By this time, I got a bit educated around startups and tech.
- My goal was to make enough to build a product, something that I can sell recurringly without working again.
- I started with providing Arduino programming services on Fiverr.
- Searching all day how to get that first gig, I finally landed a client who needed it.
- Around this time (end of 2019), I was also learning how to build custom boards, was willing to startup with it!
- Very early, I realized hardware is something tough to get into. Would require a lot of invetment, came across the term SaaS (software as a service).
- I had a very rough idea in my head of what software I am willing to build but anyway, I tried testing and creating a proof of concept.
- Fortunately, the tuts I followed for building it had a nice structure around what every tech/framework involved is doing.
- That was a start of my journey of learning how to code, feb 2020.

**— 2020**

- I am so so thankful to all the forums, online communities, video creators, bloggers who are helping millions like me learn remotely!
- Very early in 2020, I joined online communities discussing startups and programming.
- I made some amazing friends who guided me on tech stacks to learn & use, solving errors and everything I would not have been able to find support for, offline.
- I worked on some IOT idea I had while freelancing as an arduino programmer. Meanwhile learning web development. 
- Would have to mention that almost everything I learnt was not well structured, I just picked up frameworks when I needed them and kept hacking!
- Because of not having a good network, I was so insecure whether what I am learning is relevant or not, I was tempting to intern somewhere to validate my skills.
- Applied to random startups on Angel list, got accepted by one. Got fluent with building backend/APIs while working there. Can't say it was a good experience, left the company on a really bad note.
- Now, I had much more experience around startups and tech. I realized I need to level up my engineering skills to work with better organizations and on more impactful projects.
- Obviously, I needed a better system for doing so, I decided to start freelance again to earn a better PC and focus on learning. 
- I did another internship for about a month, developed multiple portfolio projects, did some freelance work and got a PC in a little more than 2.5 months (yay!!) - **August 18**.
- Now I was finally ready to start learning and building products (**the obsession for which it all started**)
- I working on a boring idea of a note taking app named Kotaru, made a prototype in 15-16 days.
- Got a lot, a lot of hype on Twitter, might link the tweet which got viral, later. It wasn't intentional because that was just a trial, was willing to launch a lot more stuff vv soon.
- Got some people to work with me at Kotaru, since then we brainstormed a lot and did multiple tweakings. Revamped the UI and stack 3 times.
- I worked on a chrome extension that adds your browser highlights to your twitter feed and provides an intuitive way to refer back to snippets you saved for later, I sent to the beta users and they liked the concept (it's WIP).
- I participated in the Devfolio InOut hackathon and delivered an amazing hack, results are yet to be announced.
- I applied for the [BUIDL grant](https://twitter.com/atroyn/status/1333860797714370561) by [Anton](https://twitter.com/atroyn), got accepted and successfully built a product named forum.dev in 7 days without tweeting haha. Collaborated with a dev, it's another WIP.       

I was finally be able to make a debut in programming and project building, this year. I'm going to spend the next entire year building products, learning tech & working at impactful startups. ([a not to myself](https://twitter.com/novadigvijay/status/1342112672809041921)).

**— advice**

This section is a WIP but I want to address the questions around finding your passion. In the past years I have spent enormous amount of time thinking how do I find 
what I love doing. I have generalized some of the tactics wrt my journey so far.     
1. You don't discover your passion, you develop it so develop interests.
2. Interact with individuals from different paradigms, make friends online.
3. Explore and go deep in the subjects you like.
4. It is never that one magical thing so combine multiple actiities for a creative output/career.
5. Stay curious for almost everything.
The sum of all these basic practises will eventually help you learn a lot and figure out your art.

<!-- ## // explorations

When I look back, I have spent my time since 8th standard (11 y/o) trying things out which led me discover what I enjoy doing.  I wrote a short book, started
youtube channels, tried making documentaries, launched an app, put together electronic boards. Just exploring and staying curious was the hack to find interests!

## // bootstrapped

Honestly, 2020 is the year I grew the most and it wouldn't have been possible without the descreased academic pressure because of covid. It's funny, I started my career
in a pandemic!! There were certainly big realizations I had this year which laid a foundation for me to approach things. It's when I discovered my "art" and learnt combining
interests. 

Finding relevant online communities early this year accelerated my explorations!      

I am ready to take off now!

*take off = explore tech, build and create impact.

## // 2021

![tweet](/2020/tweet.png)

## // evergreen

— some questions below with no generic answers, I want to keep addressing them personally and publish on the internet.

**"What's the meaning of life"**    
Based on what I explored, there's no meaning. I am a part of this never ending, infinite cosmos, so why would my efforts matter to anyone? The mindset which is idealized by me
is to consider my work as art, something that is done for the sake of doing it. One is supposed to find that interest or hobby and find their own meaning.

**"How do I find my passion?"**

An advice I would want to give my younger  self is to just explore, stay curious, develop interests. This is the year when I realized the notion that there is
that one magical thing which will always keep you interested is all wrong.    

Meeting new people can be a catalyst in building interests.

Examining the life of people like Da Vinci, Carl Sagan, Hawkings, Tesla, Aaron Swartz, I have always thought what made these individuals do wonders, what drove them?
Well, I didn't got any solid answer and mine may not make sense for others but on a broader level, it's the curiosity which they had. -->

Well, I didn't got any solid answer and mine may not make sense for others but on a broader level, it's the curiosity which they had. The straight forward question for me was,
what to be curious about? Simple, what do I like? When I look back, I have spent my time since 8th standard (11 y/o) trying things out which led me discover what I enjoy doing.

all wrong. Naval Ravikant puts it better, in [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qHkcs3kG44) episode.     
Another question that often drives me crazy is what the meaning of life is. -->
