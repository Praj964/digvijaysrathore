Last week, I was watching [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8izRLUdEPA&t=864s) video by [R.C. Waldun](https://rcwaldun.com/). 
I was able to resonate with it so much that decide to write a note around it. Let's develop a mental model for learning things 
by self (go to the numbered list).

- Education have always been a tool to discover about oneself and the world around us.
- If you look at the medieval history, there were philosophers/explorers/scientists who
change the course of the society upto what it looks like today. These individuals
used knowledge as a source to facilitate wisdom not just for bettering themselves economically, 
the idea sold by most of the institutes today.
- Unfortunately, by the end of 20th century this whole process of exploration in the ways of 
sciences have been objectified, has turned into a checklist of courses and defined paths.
- This shift has led to the change in certain practices and how we approach learning. 
Instead of encouraging students to dive deeper in the subjects, they are burdened with all 
these criterias & rules to fulfill.
- This system of learning (the current one), overtime changes how we operate, we start pursuing 
everything in a competitive manner. We put ranks and grades on pedestal, that kills the beauty 
of how and why humans learn.
- Education is supposed to be something organic (important!) and not scoped to a classroom.
- Our curriculums gives birth to the completion mindset (explained in the next set of points).

Being students, it's not effective to seek a reform from the authorities. Instead RC 
suggests the concept of being a Rogue Academic. One has to â€”    
1. Learn things from a place of genuine interest/excitement.
2. Resist the myth of completion. You can complete all the assignements & 
ace the tests with the hacks by your coaching institute but still know nothing
about the subject.
3. Resume/ start learning outside the classroom/curriculums. Go deep and wide. Do extra research.
4. Connect the dots between multiple concepts/disciplines. Smart folks combine interests.
5. Make friends and share notes, talk a lot (often not encouraged in schools).
6. Even if it is a core subject like maths or physics, don't get worried about tests & grades. That number shouldn't affect your view about your interest yourself.

Well this might seem very obvious but I wanted to make this thinking concrete and pursue 
it as a fundamental mental model.     

If you did like to add something to this note, ping me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/novadigvijay). 
I am trying to make a handbook for rogue learners.
