Hey! I'm Digvijay, developer who love building products and tinkering with different technologies.

I maintain a public collection of notes (around everything I do and think) on my site, [digvijaysr.com](https://digvijaysr.com/notes).

> Most of my work is in private repositories but you may find some open source projects here, too. 

----

I am keeping this repository open source to let anyone fork and start publishing their "notes" online; this concept is synonymous with [digital gardening](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden).

Together building a community of independent domains that we network together in novel ways, to build decentralized media, read more [here](https://balajis.com/how-to-gradually-exit-twitter/). You can [fork](https://github.com/digvijaysrathore/digvijaysrathore/fork) and deploy on your own.

You can find a list of individuals who maintain a public wiki or knowledge base [here](https://digvijaysr.com/note/wikis)

> Edit [/wikis.md]() to add a link to your wiki. I request you to keep a backlink to this repository on your site.
